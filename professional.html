            <h2 id="intro">As stated previously on the home page, I graduated Cum Laude with my Bachelors degree in Geology 
                and a minor in Business Administration. During college, I worked for my mother's business (Hay Gulch Properties LLC.) in managing
                and rennovating rental properties in the Denver Metro area. After graduating from college, I worked for a company called FractureID Inc. 
                which is a company that specializes in geophysical data processing. While working for FractureID, I 
                used Python and SQL coding on a daily basis to prepare data for further processing. After working for Fracture ID for about 2 and a half years,
                I worked for a geochemical laboratory called Surtek Inc. Surtek specializes in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) where they injected surfactants into 
                tapped oil reservoirs to further recover more oil. While there, in addition to my duties as a scientist, I worked on enhancing the laboratory and office ordering
                process by creating newer Excel Spreadsheets to handle the vast amounts of ordering. After also working for Surtek Inc. for
                2 and a half years, I am currently enrolled in the Flatiron School Software Engineering Bootcamp program. I am learning to code in JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
                Ruby, SQL, and other coding languages. I am ecstatic to be learning more and continuing to grow as an individual.
