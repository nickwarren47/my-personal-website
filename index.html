                <h2>Thank you for checking out my website! To get to know me better,
                    please read my bio below...</h2>
                    <p>The Nick Warren Story: Well to be honest, 
                        I'm actually not that good at talking about myself. 
                        I am a Geologist by education where I graduated from 
                        the University of Colorado with my bachelors in Geology 
                        (Cum Laude) and a minor in Business Administration.
                    </p>

                <p>Being a Geologist is great but my passion lies more in 
                    hunting for rocks and minerals. The thrill of the "hunt" 
                    is incredibly exhilirating. To find a fossil, for instance, that 
                    has been underground for millions of years and hasn't seen
                    the light of day in that same amount of time, is mind boggling.
                    To be the first human to find it is where words can not describe
                    the feeling.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to hunting for rocks and minerals, I am also
                    an avid scuba diver. I currently have been on 12 dives in 
                    Jamaica and the Bahamas. My wife, who became certified long
                    before me, has dove in the Great Barrior Reef in addition to 
                    dives we have been on together.
                </p>
                <p> My wife and I love to travel! Our goal is to visit new places. 
                    My wifes' and my current list of countries visited (collectively) are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Israel</li>
                        <li>Australia</li>
                        <li>Aruba</li>
                        <li>Jamaica</li>
                        <li>Honduras</li>
                        <li>Mexico</li>
                        <li>Bahamas</li>

                    </ul>
