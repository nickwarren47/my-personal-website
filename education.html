        <h3>My studies at the University of Colorado</h3>
            </p>At the University of Colorado, my studies focused primarily on 
            science, math, and related courses. See below for a full listing of
            my science, math, and related courses: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chemistry 1</li>

                <li>Environmental Studies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While also taking Geology/Science courses, I also enrolled in a business minor 
                program. The courses for this program are listed below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Management</li>
                <li>Innovation</li>
                <li>Intro to Entrpreneurship</li>
                <li>Professional Business Plan Development</li>
                <li>Finance</li>
                <li>Accounting</li>
                <li>Marketing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, while studying at the University, I also worked on 
                my own geology honors thesis research. During my research, I gathered
                data from fossilized stromatolite rock outcroppings in both Colorado
                and Wyoming. While working on the research, I was advised by both Dr. James
                Hagadorn (Currator of the Geology Collection at the Denver Museum of Nature 
                and Science) and Dr. Stephen Mojzsis (University of Colorado, Planetary Geology Dept.).
                After writing my thesis, I then defended it infront of a panel of respected scientists
                in both the geology and biology fields. My panel consisted of: Dr. James
                Hagadorn (Currator of the Geology Collection at the Denver Museum of Nature 
                and Science) and Dr. Stephen Mojzsis (University of Colorado, Planetary Geology Dept.),
                Dr. Charles Stern (University of Colorado, Mineralogy Dept.), and Dr. Noah Fierer (University of Colorado, 
                Biology Dept.). After sucessfully defending my thesis, I was awarded Cum Laude honors and my 
                paper was published by the University of Colorado honors journal. To see a complete copy of my thesis,
